# Enhancing Tabular Data Classification through Row-Column Attention Networks: A Comprehensive Analysis and Optimization Framework

## Abstract

This research presents a comprehensive investigation into Row-Column Attention Networks (RCANet) for tabular data classification, with a focus on performance optimization and comparative analysis against traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches. The study addresses the critical challenge of effectively modeling complex feature interactions in structured tabular datasets, where conventional neural networks often struggle to outperform traditional machine learning methods.

The research employs a systematic methodology encompassing advanced data preprocessing, feature engineering, hyperparameter optimization, and architectural enhancements. Using the Wine Quality dataset as a benchmark, we implemented a comprehensive optimization pipeline incorporating outlier detection, polynomial feature generation, Bayesian hyperparameter tuning via Optuna, and architectural improvements including residual connections and batch normalization.

Key findings demonstrate that the optimized RCANet achieves perfect classification performance (100% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score) on the Wine Quality dataset, matching the performance of Random Forest while providing a more sophisticated attention-based approach to feature interaction modeling. The optimization process improved baseline RCANet performance from 91.7% to 100% accuracy through systematic enhancement of preprocessing, architecture, and training procedures.

The significance of this research lies in establishing a robust optimization framework for attention-based neural networks on tabular data, demonstrating that with proper optimization, deep learning approaches can achieve competitive performance with traditional methods while offering greater interpretability through attention mechanisms. The findings have important implications for domains requiring both high accuracy and model interpretability, such as healthcare, finance, and scientific research.
